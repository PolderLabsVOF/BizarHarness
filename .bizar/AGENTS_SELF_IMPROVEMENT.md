# Self Improvement

Project-level agent learning. Entries are auto-appended by Odin at task completion and read at session start.

## Active Rules
1. **Per-project Hindsight banks** — every project gets its own bank; default is for general/system knowledge only
2. **Session start bank check** — always call `hindsight_list_banks` to discover and set the correct bank
3. **Never use default for project work** — pass `bank_id: "<project-name>"` in all Hindsight calls
4. **Create bank if missing** — if no bank exists for a project, create it with `hindsight_create_bank`
5. **AMS Studio bank populated** — 40+ documents migrated from default to ams-studio bank

## Log

### 2026-06-16: Created .bizar/ folder
- **Context**: Centralizing all BizarHarness project data into a single folder
- **Lesson**: Keeping project root clean — all agent-learning data in one place
- **Pattern**: Use `.bizar/` for all BizarHarness project data (self-improvement, design, memories)
- **Files**: .bizar/
- **Agent**: odin

### 2026-06-16: Migrated ams-studio memories + enforced per-project Hindsight banks
- **Context**: AMS Studio memories were scattered across 75 docs in the default bank instead of the ams-studio bank. All 10 agent files said "use default bank".
- **Lesson**: Per-project bank policy was documented but not enforced — agents kept writing to default. Need explicit bank selection logic at session start.
- **Pattern**: At session start: (1) `hindsight_list_banks` (2) determine project name (3) `hindsight_recall` with correct `bank_id` (4) create bank if missing
- **Files**: ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md, ~/.config/opencode/agents/odin.md, heimdall.md, mimir.md, vor.md, hermod.md, thor.md, baldr.md, tyr.md, vidarr.md, forseti.md
- **Agent**: thor, tyr
- **Details**: 40+ ams-studio docs migrated via `hindsight_sync_retain`. All agent files updated to use per-project banks with `bank_id` parameter. AGENTS.md now has bank selection rules table. Odin updated with session-start bank workflow.

## 2026-06-16: Windows compat fixes for npm package

**Files changed:**
- `cli/copy.mjs`: Replaced `lastIndexOf('/')` with `dirname()` for cross-platform path handling
- `cli/utils.mjs`: Added `isWin` detection, separate Windows/Nix config dir logic, Windows npm paths for version detection, extracted `tryReadVersion()` helper
- `.gitignore`: Added `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`

**Key insight:** The hardcoded `/` path separator was the most subtle Windows bug — `lastIndexOf('/')` for parent dir silently returns `-1` on `C:\...` paths, which doesn't crash `slice()` but produces wrong paths. `path.dirname()` is the correct cross-platform API.
