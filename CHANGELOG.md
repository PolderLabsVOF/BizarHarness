# Changelog

## v2.4.0 — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Install pipeline now produces a complete, working opencode.json** with all 13 agents and 9 commands registered. Previously the template was missing `agent` and `command` blocks, causing slash commands to silently disappear from the TUI.
- **Silent bail on fresh installs** when `~/.config/opencode` didn't exist — the postinstall now creates the directory and bootstraps opencode.json from the package template.
- **False-positive "Bizar plugin source not found" warning** removed (plugin lives in a separate npm package; the global install path is canonical).
- **Stale `config/opencode.json.template`** deleted (it was a duplicate of `opencode.json`).
- **TDZ bug in `runPostInstall()`** — an inner `join` import shadowed the module-level one, causing a ReferenceError on first run.

### Added
- **`installCommandsBizar()`** — symlink-safe install of Bizar commands to `commands-bizar/` (separate from ECC's `commands/` symlink target, so it doesn't collide).
- **`/bizar` menu slash command** — routes to @odin with a routing help file that lists all available Bizar actions and dispatches based on user intent. New TUI entry: type `/bizar what you want to do` and Odin routes.
- **`/plan` and `/visual-plan` TUI commands** — these plugin-handled slash commands now appear in autocomplete (previously only worked when typed in chat).
- **Missing command files** — `config/commands/plan.md` and `config/commands/visual-plan.md` added to match the 9-command template.

### Behavior changes
- Commands now install to `~/.config/opencode/commands-bizar/` instead of `~/.config/opencode/commands/` (the latter is a symlink to ECC's commands on this user's machine). The template paths in opencode.json were updated to match.
