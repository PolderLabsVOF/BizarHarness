# Changelog

## Unreleased
## [10.10.1] - 2026-07-30

- Fixed broken relative imports in UserPromptSubmit hooks (`control-inbox.mjs`,
  `worker-suggest.mjs`) that failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` after
  installation when the project source lived at any path other than the
  build-time assumption. Imports are now resolved via `import.meta.url` +
  dynamic `import()` anchored to the script's own location.



- Made Bizar-agent routing mandatory for every primary request and added
  all-subagent official-documentation grounding with mechanically verified
  `WebSearch` access.

## 10.9.0 — 2026-07-30

- Removed the retired web control plane, bundled browser extensions, local artifact editor, service/deployment plumbing, and their dependencies and tests.
- Removed the Bizar note-vault/search subsystem, its MCP tools, CLI commands, skills, configuration, and SDK exports.
- Added guarded Git/GitHub publication, simplify-before-commit, prose-quality, intelligent compaction, local telemetry, and reviewer-context hooks.
- Added approval-aware GitHub workflow skills and executable removed-surface verification.
- Updated optional browser verification to the official `agent-browser` CLI/MCP lifecycle and CubeSandbox to the current E2B-compatible API.
- Re-audited the retained Claude Code harness, removed a duplicate agent identity and nonexistent visual-plan command, and replaced stale architecture and feature state.
- Removed abandoned install/plugin/scheduler/eval fixtures, committed runtime and editor metadata, generated package residue, and a broken external skill-cache symlink.
- Narrowed the npm publication boundary from 427 to 260 files, eliminating tests, duplicate skills, and local-state leakage; added executable structure/package checks and synchronized version metadata.
- Isolated editing agents in Git worktrees rooted at the current `HEAD`, with safe shared-dependency bootstrap and mechanically verified agent policy.
- Added a durable SQLite task DAG with dependency-aware claims, expiring leases, workspace ownership, conservative path collision checks, and edit-hook enforcement.
- Added a serialized integration queue with single-consumer ordering, verification evidence, repair routing, and no implicit merge, push, or publication side effects.
- Documented the 2026 multi-agent harness comparison and prioritized roadmap for collision-free collaboration, replayable execution, and stronger observability.
