## In Progress — F-117 Repository Structure Cleanup

**Objective:** Remove confirmed obsolete files, abandoned fixtures, generated
residue, and package-boundary leaks while preserving every retained Claude Code
harness behavior.

### Behavior lock

- `make check`: passed before cleanup.
- `make test`: 298 SDK tests and 267 Node/CLI/hook/script tests passed.
- `npm pack --dry-run`: baseline captured at 427 files; the package currently
  leaks 29 test files and one stale literal-`${HOME}` memory path.

### Cleanup plan

1. Delete tracked dead paths with no retained references: the `fresh901` install
   fixture, retired `bizar-plugins` registry, committed `.config` hook log,
   project-local Serena config, obsolete Docker ignore file, root Skills CLI
   lock, retired eval fixtures, and retired schedule templates.
2. Remove local generated residue proven unrelated to source: literal `${HOME}`
   trees, package tarballs, duplicate Skills CLI caches, old resume logs,
   abandoned fixture dependencies, stale package-local runtime data, and
   already-retired template remnants.
3. Rewrite ignore/package boundaries around the current Claude Code harness;
   eliminate Cline/Vite/dashboard/memory-era rules and prevent tests, local
   state, duplicate skill mirrors, and source-only tooling from entering the
   published package.
4. Add executable repository/package structure regression checks before the
   deletion pass, then run targeted validation after each smell category.
5. Synchronize architecture, packaging, and cleanup documentation and close the
   feature only after the full test, E2E, clean-state, audit, eval, and VCR gates.

### Fallback review

- Production masking fallbacks: none found in the cleanup scope.
- `catch {}` findings are confined to test cleanup or fixtures that detect
  swallowed errors; the test teardown is a grounded best-effort cleanup path.
- Documentation mentioning model fallbacks is decision guidance, not an
  alternate runtime path.
- Escalation: none required; no ambiguous cross-layer fallback is being changed.

### Explicit exclusions

- `research/` is user-owned comparative research and remains untouched.
- Root `node_modules/`, `.omx/`, and current bounded `.bizar/` operational state
  remain local runtime material, not cleanup targets during the active session.
- No retained CLI, SDK, MCP, hook, agent, command, or skill behavior is in scope
  for redesign.

### Blockers

None.
